#   Overall Note: The tutorial does not say anything aut the response code expected.
#                Even the success code is not always the same! It takes 200, 201, 204 depending on the API


    Background:
        Given I set the tutorial 602


#

#       Note: The expected body in the Tutorial has the following differences with respect to the current Orion-LD version:
#             1) attribute '@context' expected 'https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context-v1.3.jsonld'
#                current 'https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context.jsonld'. In this respect
#                the text itself of the tutorial shall be corrected
